# Smart Citizen Service Hub

Hi there! 
This is a Salesforce project I built called the **Smart Citizen Service Hub**.  
Itâ€™s an Experience Cloud site where citizens can easily submit service requests (like Garbage, Road, or Electricity issues) and track their status online.

## What this project does
- Citizens can file service requests quickly through a public portal.
- Each request automatically gets assigned to the right department based on its type.
- Confirmation emails are sent after a request is submitted.
- Critical requests go through a supervisor approval process.
- Reports and dashboards help track the most common issues and open critical requests.

## What I built
- Custom Objects: Citizen, Service Request, Department
- Lookup Relationships between Service Request and Citizen/Department
- Flows: Screen Flows, Record-Triggered Flows, and a Scheduled Flow for escalations
- Approval Process for critical priority requests
- Validation Rules to make sure users submit important details
- Experience Cloud Site with a custom screen to submit requests
- Reports to track request types and critical open cases
- A simple dashboard to visualize everything

## Whatâ€™s inside the folder
- **Design Document**: Explains everything (objects, flows, site setup, permissions, etc.)
- **Screenshots**: Step-by-step screenshots of the site, flows, reports, and dashboards.

**Concepts Covered**
- Salesforce Experience Cloud
- Flows (Screen, Record-Triggered, Scheduled)
- Approval Process
- Validation Rules
- Reports & Dashboards
- Public Site Security & Guest User Permissions
